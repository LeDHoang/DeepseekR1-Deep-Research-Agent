# Deep Research Assistant

Deep Research Assistant is an AI-powered research tool that leverages a multi-agent framework using CrewAI. It conducts comprehensive research, analyzes gathered data, and synthesizes clear, structured reports. The project supports both online models (via OpenAI) and local models (via Ollama) and integrates advanced search tools to retrieve real-time data from the web.

## Project Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project environment and install the required dependencies.

### Setup Virtual Environment

Create a new virtual environment using Python 3.11:

```bash
python3.11 -m venv myenv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- **On macOS/Linux:**

  ```bash
  source myenv/bin/activate
  ```

- **On Windows:**

  ```bash
  myenv\Scripts\activate
  ```

### Install Dependencies

Install the main project dependencies:

```bash
pip install crewai python-dotenv langchain_openai langchain_community
```

Install additional tools for CrewAI:

```bash
pip install 'crewai[tools]'
```

### Next Steps

Run the Streamlit application:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit-based.py
```

After completing these steps, your environment will be set up and ready for development. Make sure to run all project-related commands within this activated virtual environment.
